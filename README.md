Implementing the menu to use a vector of Filter* was more difficult than 
anticipated and we ran into several problems. When using the binary filter after creating one output image already, we would sometimes get a bad_alloc error. We are unsure of what actually caused the bad_alloc error but eventually we changed the way we were running the binary filter and it was fixed.
